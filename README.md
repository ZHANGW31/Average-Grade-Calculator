# Average-Grade-Calculator

Console Application for Calculating Average Scores based on user input

This is the first iteration of my Average Score Calculator Console Application

How it works:
Takes user input on how many scores they want to input to calculate

Takes the user input and evaluates to ensure that the number is between 0 and 100.

If the number is not between 0 and 100, it removes a counter and display a message to the user asking for a valid number.

Once the number of scores is reached, the application take the sum of all of the correct inputted scores and calculates the average and displays the average as well as the grade score to the user.

The SmartScoring.cs project is the same console application but with a different feature.

It allows the user to continuously enter grades until they are ready to calculate the average.

When the user is ready to compute the average, they enter 000 and press enter.
